**pg_govLite** is designed to perform basic data governance tasks in metadata management, complementing [System Catalogs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalogs.html) and acting as a unified metadata store. It manages the Medallion architecture and *tags* for all data objects (columns, tables, schemas, functions, etc.), with [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) semantic tags, and [governed tags](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/governed-tags/).
